I was inspired by the YearCompass PDF's, because I don't like to fill out PDF's.

Overview
The Yearly Compass Recap Web App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It is designed to provide users with a digital platform for recapping and planning their year, inspired by the YearCompass initiative.

Features

Yearly Recap: Create digital recaps of your past years, summarizing achievements, challenges, and lessons learned.

Yearly Planning: Plan for the upcoming year by setting goals, priorities, and intentions.

PDF Export: Generate and download PDF versions of your recaps for offline access and printing.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
